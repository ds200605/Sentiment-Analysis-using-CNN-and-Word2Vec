      "Apart from its own considerable achievement , Metropolis confirms Tezuka 's status as both the primary visual influence on the anim脙漏 tradition and its defining philosophical conscience .\n",
      "B脙漏art and Berling are both superb , while Huppert ... is magnificent .\n",
      "Thanks to The Ch脙垄teau 's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises .\n",

      "The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on B脙录ttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history .\n",
      "While Guzm脙隆n frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet 's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable .\n",
      "A fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clich脙漏s and showcases a group of dedicated artists .\n",
      "With elements cribbed from Lang 's Metropolis , Welles ' Kane , and Eisenstein 's Potemkin , the true wonder of Rintar脙麓 's Metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own .\n",
      "A coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clich脙漏s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood .\n",

      "Absurdities and clich脙漏s accumulate like lint in a fat man 's navel .\n",
      "Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clich脙漏d white-trash situation imaginable .\n",
      "Typical anim脙漏 , with cheapo animation ( like Saturday morning TV in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .\n",

      "As social expos脙漏 , Skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on .\n",
      "The Ch脙垄teau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .\n",
      "An overstylized , pur脙漏ed m脙漏lange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy .\n",

      "Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich脙漏s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block .\n",
      "In the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r脙漏sum脙漏 loaded with credits like `` Girl in Bar # 3 . ''\n",
      "In its own way , Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Bu脙卤uel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .\n",
      "Not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich脙漏 left unsaid .\n",
      "First-time director Jo脙拢o Pedro Rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .\n",

      "Got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2脗聽1\\/2 - hour , dissipated length .\n",
      "With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich脙漏s .\n",
      "Her film is like a beautiful food entr脙漏e that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .\n",
      "Though Jones and Snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clich脙漏 .\n",
      "Contrived pastiche of caper clich脙漏s .\n",
      "A collage of clich脙漏s and a dim echo of allusions to other films .\n",
      "The film is like sitting in a downtown caf脙漏 , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .\n",
      "It 's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of Action Man clich脙漏 atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( Woo 's ) best work .\n",
      "Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich脙漏 .\n",
      "Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clich脙漏s .\n",
      "Five screenwriters are credited with the clich脙漏-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .\n",
      "An uninspired preachy and clich脙漏d war film .\n",
      "It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m脙漏tier .\n",
      "Amid the clich脙漏 and foreshadowing , Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn .\n",
      "Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clich脙漏s .\n",
      "Plays like John Le Carr脙漏 with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .\n",

      "It recycles every clich脙漏 about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .\n",
      "The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a souffl脙漏 gone wrong .\n",
      "After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clich脙漏s , depression and bad alternative music .\n",
      "How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of ( Fran脙搂ois and Mich脙篓le 's ) relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .\n",
      "Rather less than the sum of its underventilated p脙篓re-fils confrontations .\n",
      "Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl脙漏 .\n",
      "For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2脗聽1\\/2 - hour running time .\n",
      "Stale and clich脙漏d to a fault .\n",
      "The movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clich脙漏d and too often strains credulity .\n",
      "Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its 脙漏lan , humor , bile , and irony .\n",

      "The threat implied in the title Pok脙漏mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .\n",
      "Marinated in clich脙漏s and mawkish dialogue .\n",
      "It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich脙漏s the filmmakers could dredge up .\n",
      "If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel ( or Robert Aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and clich脙漏 .\n",
      "This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of Am脙漏lie .\n",
      "Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na脙炉f 's encounter with the world .\n",
